# IP01-Wk1-Code-Challenge
In this toystory, Iâ€™ll be creating **Python functions** that solve a variety of problems, as explained below.
## Description
**These are Python functions that perform the tasks indicated below.**
  ### Challenge 1: Converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time
- I have written a function that takes an hour in the range of between `1` to `12`, minutes in range of between `0` to `59` and a period of either __"am"__ or __"pm"__ as inputs.
- The return value is a four-digit string encoding time in 24-hour time.
### Challenge 2: Two numbers are positive.
 - I have written a function that takes three integers __a,b,c__ as arguments and returns `True` if exactly two of the three intergers are positive numbers (greater than 0), and `False` -otherwise.
  ### Challenge 3: Consonant value
 - I have written a function that when a lowercase string is passed with alphabetical characters only and no spaces, it returns the highest value of constant substrings.
 - **Consonants** are any letters of the alphabet except `aeiou`.
 - Values are assigned as follows: `a=1, b=2, c=3, ...z=26`.
